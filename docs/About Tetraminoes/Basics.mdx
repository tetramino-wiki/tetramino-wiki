## Markdown
Markdown is a simple markup language that is used to format text. It is used in many places, including this website. You can find a guide on how to use markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

There are many other great markdown guides out there, so feel free to use any of them.

## Fumen
:::note
Fumen redering unfortunately requires a bit of setup/code. If you want a explanation on how the example below works, please refer to the [explaination](#explaination) section.
:::
In order to create a fumen embed use this React component:
```jsx
<FumenCanvas fumenData="v115@0gAtHeBtGewhAtFehlwhRpAeR4i0glwhRpR4Ceg0gl?whJeAgH"/>
```

`fumenData` is the fumen data you want to render.

Make sure this import is at the top of the file:
```jsx
import FumenCanvas from "@site/src/components/util/FumenCanvas";
```

### Explaination

#### What is a component?
A component is a piece of code that the computer uses to display something on the screen. In this case, the component is the fumenCanvas.

#### The import
```jsx
import FumenCanvas from "@site/src/components/util/FumenCanvas";
```
This line imports the fumenCanvas component from the `@site/src/components/util/FumenCanvas` file. This is the file that contains the code for the fumenCanvas component.

#### The "fumenData"
While the component is really just the type of thing we want to display, we need to tell it what to display. This is done by passing it a "prop". A prop is a piece of data that we pass to the component. In this case, we pass the fumenData prop to the component. The fumenData prop is a string that contains the fumen data we want to display.

And so after all that we get this:
```jsx
import FumenCanvas from "@site/src/components/util/FumenCanvas";


<FumenCanvas fumenData="v115@0gAtHeBtGewhAtFehlwhRpAeR4i0glwhRpR4Ceg0gl?whJeAgH"/>
```

## Video
:::note
Video redering unfortunately requires a bit of setup/code. If you want a explanation on how the example below works, please refer to the [explaination](#explaination-1) section.
:::
In order to create a video embed use this React component:
```jsx
<YtEmbed videoId="q_zU-YO0Ivg"></YtEmbed>
```

`videoId` is the id of the video you want to render.

Make sure this import is at the top of the file:
```jsx
import YtEmbed from "@site/src/components/util/YtEmbed";
```

### Explaination
Most of the explaination is the same as the fumenCanvas, so I will only explain the differences.

#### The prop
This time we pass the videoId prop to the component. The videoId prop is a string that contains the id of the video we want to display.

#### How to get the video id
The video id is the part of the url after `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=`. For example, the video id of `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_zU-YO0Ivg` is `q_zU-YO0Ivg`.

And so after all that we get this:
```jsx
import YtEmbed from "@site/src/components/util/YtEmbed";

<YtEmbed videoId="q_zU-YO0Ivg"></YtEmbed>
```
