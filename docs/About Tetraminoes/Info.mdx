[Tetraminoes](https://tetraminoes.com) purpose is to provide information in all aspects of Tetris. 

Like everyone else, we were once beginners too. Eager to learn and become better at this game, we strived to find information to improve and grow as players. However, information that was easily accesible, well organized, and relevant was few and far between. 

Our knowledge and growth often relied on seeking advice in forums, Discord channels, or among friends. This was a problem that we identified, the current method of attaining knowledge doesn't do a good job of  promoting growth or building up a sustainable community. It's why we created this site.
