A TSS → TSD → (TSS →) PC opener created by [ゆう](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsltaGhBbx73YzPRp0llgOw). Single Double PC is an opener [recommended](https://tetrisopener.wicurio.com/index.php?%E3%83%86%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E5%88%9D%E5%BF%83%E8%80%85%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%83%86%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC) by the creator for beginners, along with [Triple Triple PC](https://four.lol/openers/tt-pc).

The opener leaves a clean field after the TSD, making it easy to follow up with normal stacking when you cannot achieve the perfect clear.

While this opener's only requirement is an early O_mino, this opener often requires multiple soft drops while setting up the TSS and TSD, which makes it slow to carry out the attacks.

You will rarely be able to achieve the perfect clear in Tetris vs. Tetris matches. However, you will have a much higher chance in Tetris vs. Puyo matches because Puyo Puyo players' first attack is usually slower in terms of timing. The TSS, B2B TSD, B2B TSS (not always possible but possible in many PC solutions), and PC are decent attacks against Puyo Puyo, which you will carry out with just 3 bags.
