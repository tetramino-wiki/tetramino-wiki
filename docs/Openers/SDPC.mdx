A TSS → TSD → (TSS →) PC opener created by [ゆう](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsltaGhBbx73YzPRp0llgOw). Single Double PC is an opener [recommended](https://tetrisopener.wicurio.com/index.php?%E3%83%86%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E5%88%9D%E5%BF%83%E8%80%85%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%83%86%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC) by the creator for beginners, along with [Triple Triple PC](https://four.lol/openers/tt-pc).

The opener leaves a clean field after the TSD, making it easy to follow up with normal stacking when you cannot achieve the perfect clear.

While this opener's only requirement is an early O_mino, this opener often requires multiple soft drops while setting up the TSS and TSD, which makes it slow to carry out the attacks.

You will rarely be able to achieve the perfect clear in Tetris vs. Tetris matches. However, you will have a much higher chance in Tetris vs. Puyo matches because Puyo Puyo players' first attack is usually slower in terms of timing. The TSS, B2B TSD, B2B TSS (not always possible but possible in many PC solutions), and PC are decent attacks against Puyo Puyo, which you will carry out with just 3 bags.

## PC

The PC chance itself is 97.18%, and the chance goes up to 100% when you have T_mino as your first piece. You will have the opportunity to do an extra TSS for many solutions.

### General

You will have a 47.6% and 41.2% chance to PC the first way and second way, respectively. Your PC chance is 75.6% with these two solutions alone. These are easy to spot and are worth memorizing.

### TSS
If you can place your t_mino in your 3rd bag like below (this would be a T-Spin Single),

<FumenCanvas fumenData="v115@zgA8IeC8GeD8CeG8AeywH8wwC8JeAgH"/>

you will have an extremely high chance of PC (99.44%) with these three solutions (the first two are the same as above):

<FumenCanvas fumenData="v115@zgA8i0whilRpC8g0whglR4RpD8whR4G8whywH8wwC8?JeAgH"/> <FumenCanvas fumenData="v115@zgA8zhh0AtRpC8hlg0BtRpD8glg0AtG8glywH8wwC8?JeAgH"/> <FumenCanvas fumenData="v115@zgA8zhg0R4RpC8hli0RpD8glR4G8glywH8wwC8JeAg?H"/>

The reason why the PC chance is 99.44% (716/720) instead of 100% is that there are 4 failing sequences where placing the T as above will not work when you get T as the first piece for your 3rd bag: T_mino I_mino J_mino L_mino Z_mino S_mino O_mino, T_mino J_mino I_mino L_mino Z_mino S_mino O_mino , T_mino J_mino I_mino Z_mino L_mino S_mino O_mino , and T_mino I_mino J_mino Z_mino L_mino S_mino O_mino . For these, you will be able to PC with this instead:
